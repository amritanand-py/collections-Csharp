# Welcome to Collections in C#

**Collection -** A collection refers to a group of related objects or elements. Collections provide a way to organize and manipulate groups of items efficiently.

**Types of Collection in C#**

 - Array
 - List
 - Sets
 - Dictionaries
 - Queues
 - Stacks
 - ArrayList
 - LinkedList
 - Hashset

## Array

**Array-** Arrays are a fundamental data structure in C# and many other programming languages. In C#, an array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Here's a basic overview of working with arrays in C#: [more](https://github.com/amritanand-py/collections-Csharp/blob/main/Array.md)

## List

**List-** A `List<T>` is a dynamic array that is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace in C#. It allows you to create a collection of elements of a specific type and provides dynamic resizing, making it easy to add, remove, or modify elements. Here's a basic overview of using `List<T>`: [more](https://github.com/amritanand-py/collections-Csharp/blob/main/List.md)

## Dictionary
**Dictionary-** In C#, a `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` is a collection that represents a set of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace. Here's a basic overview of working with dictionaries: [more](https://github.com/amritanand-py/collections-Csharp/blob/main/Dictionary.md)

## Stack
**Stack-** In C#, a `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` is a collection that represents a set of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace. Here's a basic overview of working with dictionaries:In C#, a `Stack<T>` is a collection that represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace. Here's a basic overview of working with stacks: [more](https://github.com/amritanand-py/collections-Csharp/blob/main/Stack.md)

## Queue
**Queue-** In C#, a `Queue<T>` is a collection that represents a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace. Here's a basic overview of working with queues: [more](https://github.com/amritanand-py/collections-Csharp/blob/main/Queue.md)

## LinkedList
**LinkedList-** In C#, a `LinkedList<T>` is a collection that represents a doubly linked list, where each element in the list is a node containing a value and references to the next and previous nodes. It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace. Here's a basic overview of working with `LinkedList<T>`: [more](https://github.com/amritanand-py/collections-Csharp/blob/main/LinkedList.md)
